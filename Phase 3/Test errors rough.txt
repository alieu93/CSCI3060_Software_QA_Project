Known broken tests:

Refund5 - Does not handle negative numbers (?)
	- ** Fixed by implementing a check for negative and zero numbers **

Create2 - Does not catch only alphanumeric numbers
	- ** Fixed by implementing something that checks for alphanumeric **

AddCredit2,3,4 - Does not catch that they are not admins and still prompts to enter a username despite them not being admins, causing errors
	- ** Should be fixed, by adding in a check **

buy: 
	- Transactions don't seem to subtract money from current credits of the current user
	- Transactions don't record down the amount of tickets bought and cost per ticket for that transaction for the DTF
		- ** Both should be fixed, added in the proper syntax for it **

	- buy6: Does not check if there are less tickets than expected
		- ** Should be fixed, added in a check for it **
	- buy9: Does not check first if event name exceeds 25 characters
		- ** Fixed, added in a check for it
	
	
sell:
	- DTF does not write seller's name on DTF line
		- sell2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11
		- ** Fixed by correcting syntax **
