This is the backend for Phase 4.

Use the makefile to compile the program and to run it using "make run". (make, make clean, make run)

Otherwise, javac BackEnd/*.java to compile, java BackEnd.BackEnd to run

By default from the setup of our DTF, ATF and UAF, the backend will output an error indicating an already existing event found in the Available Tickets file. This is just for the sake of indicating the program does actually run since by default, the backend will produce no terminal output if everything with the input files are fine.
